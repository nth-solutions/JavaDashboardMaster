# BioForce Technical Documentation

This document contains explanations of various technical details regarding the process of reading data from a module, organizing and manipulating it, as well as various standards used throughout the project.

## Development Information

The BioForce project uses Maven for generating project files, building the codebase, and packaging into executables. Launch4J, which builds .exes, is configured entirely in `pom.xml` and is bundled with Oracle's Java 8 for compatibility. Windows installers are generated by NSIS using the script `tools/install.nsi`.

> The Dashboard may have compatibility issues with different versions of Java 8, so when in doubt, use [Oracle JDK 8u202](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html).

GitHub Actions is used for CI/CD via Maven to automatically run tests, build executables, and publish releases when code is pushed to the repository. The jobs that are run can be configured in `.github/workflows`.

Unit tests are located at `src/test` and should be written incrementally to self-check the codebase when adding new features.

## Data Formats

`SerialComm` handles all communications between the computer and the module over a USB serial port.

### Test Data

A data sample is stored in the module as a 16-bit unsigned integer, meaning a value between 0 and 65535.
Each data sample is composed of two bytes (2 * 8 bits in a byte = 16 bits).

> Example: `ax1` `ax2` are the two bytes composing a single acceleration data sample for the X axis.

To convert from byte format to integer format, multiply the first byte by 256 and then add the second byte.

> Example: `ax` = `ax1` * 256 + `ax2`.

The bytes are stored chronologically in the `finalData` array in the following order, with all samples in a given row being from the same point in time:

| Data Sample # | Acceleration X | Acceleration Y | Acceleration Z | Gyroscope X | Gyroscope Y | Gyroscope Z | Magnetometer X | Magnetometer Y | Magnetometer Z |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|

| 11            | ax1 ax2        | ay1 ay2        | az1 az2        | gx1 gx2     | gy1 gy2     | gz1 gz2     | mx1 mx2        | my1 my2        | mz1 mz2        |

Because the magnetometer has 1/10th the sample rate of the accelerometer and gyroscope (when the latter is 240 Hz or greater), it only has data for every 10th
point on the time axis.

### Test Parameters

The test parameters associated with a test's data is stored in a .CSVP file as a series of integers separated by newlines. This .CSVP file is a custom file extension and technically is not a "comma separated" file, but this design decision is an artifact carried on from the original `DataOrganizer` codebase.

The .CSVP file is always 32 lines long, being padded with 0s and newlines after the test parameters to reach this length.

The format of `List<Integer> testParameters` is shown below:

0. Number of Tests (`0-8`)
1. Timer0 Tick Threshold (default `3848`)
2. Delay After Start (milliseconds) - default `0`
3. Battery Timeout Length (seconds) - default `300`
4. Timed Test Flag (`0`/`1`) - default `0` - *limits maximum test length to "Test Duration" field*
5. Trigger on Release Flag (`0`/`1`) - default `1` - *allows test to start when the remote button is released vs when pressed*
6. Test Duration (seconds) - default `30` - *only applicable if "Timed Test Flag" is set to 1*
7. Accel/Gyro Sample Rate (`60`/`120`/`240`/`480`/`500`/`960` Hz) - default `960`
8. Mag Sample Rate (Hz) - default `96` - *If "Accel/Gyro sample rate" â‰¥ 240, mag is 1/10 of it; otherwise, sample rate is equal*
9. Accel Sensitivity (`2`/`4`/`8`/`16` Gs) - default `4`
10. Gyro Sensitivity (`250`/`500`/`1000`/`2000` deg/s) - default `1000`
11. Accel Filter (`5`/`10`/`20`/`41`/`92`/`184`/`460`/`1130 (OFF)` Hz) - default `92`
12. Gyro Filter (`10`/`20`/`41`/`92`/`184`/`250`/`3600`/`8800 (OFF)` Hz) - default `92`
13. Accel X Offset Min
14. Accel X Offset Max
15. Accel Y Offset Min
16. Accel Y Offset Max
17. Accel Z Offset Min
18. Accel Z Offset Max

The Java representation of the test parameters, `List<Integer> testParameters`, only has elements 0-12, with 13-18, the [acceleration offsets](#acceleration-offsets), being appended on when writing the data to a .CSVP file.

### Acceleration Offsets

[Indices 13-18](#test-parameters) of `testParameters` collectively make up the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) calibration offsets. These values are signed raw data samples of the accelerometer on each axis when the module is at rest, laying on a flat surface. The maximum and minimum values correspond to the two orientations the axis can be (facing up vs facing down). Averaging these two offsets for an axis and subtracting the result from each acceleration data sample "normalizes" the value to zero, counteracts any deviation in IMU measurements.

> Note: this is NOT the same as *data normalization*, which is used for gravity compensation when the module is moving on only one axis.

In the codebase, these offsets are in the form of an `int[]` of length 9, referred to as `mpuOffsets`, or `accelOffsets`. Each element in the list is the general offset for an acceleration axis. The length of 9 was chosen in order to match the 9 sensor axes on the module, in the event that calibration offsets were ever needed for the gyroscope and magnetometer (only 3 elements are actually populated).

[`SerialComm`](#data-formats) returns these offsets in the form of an `int[][]` named `MPUMinMax`, reading data directly from the module instead of from the [`testParameters`](#test-parameters) CSVP file. This is the precursor to `mpuOffsets` and is structured as follows:

- (0) Acceleration X
    - (0) Minimum Offset
    - (1) Maximum Offset
- (1) Acceleration Y
    - (0) Minimum Offset
    - (1) Maximum Offset
- (2) Acceleration Z
    - (0) Minimum Offset
    - (1) Maximum Offset

## Data Conversion

This section describes various formats used in `DataOrganizer`, `GenericTest`, and [`AxisDataSeries`](#axis-data-series) for converting raw data samples to physical quantities.

### Data Samples

Once data is read from the module via [`SerialComm`](#data-formats) converting byte format into 16-bit unsigned integer format, the raw data samples are stored in a `List<List<Double>>` named `dataSamples`. Each inner list represents a single sensor axis (accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer along with either X, Y, or Z). The order of these lists is shown below:

1. Time
2. Acceleration X
3. Acceleration Y
4. Acceleration Z
5. Gyroscope (Angular Velocity) X
6. Gyroscope (Angular Velocity) Y
7. Gyroscope (Angular Velocity) Z
8. Magnetometer X
9. Magnetometer Y
10. Magnetometer Z

### Axis Data Series

The BioForce Graph further processes [`dataSamples`](#data-samples) into individual `AxisDataSeries` objects. Each `AxisDataSeries` represents a single axis's data (eg. Acceleration X or Angular Velocity Y). The key difference from [`dataSamples`](#data-samples) is that `AxisDataSeries` supports "virtual" axes -- generating integrated/differentiated data sets, such as velocity or angular acceleration, from native sensor data sets. In addition, `AxisDataSeries` encapsulates all methods related to data conversion, calculation, and manipulations in a single class. This improves readability and changes without affecting other portions of the codebase.

`GenericTest`, which represents all test data associated with a single module, contains the list of axes in its field `AxisDataSeries[] axes`, the format of which is described below:

0. Acceleration X
1. Acceleration Y
2. Acceleration Z
3. Acceleration Magnitude
4. Velocity X
5. Velocity Y
6. Velocity Z
7. Velocity Magnitude
8. Displacement X
9. Displacement Y
10. Displacement Z
11. Displacement Magnitude
12. Angular Acceleration X
13. Angular Acceleration Y
14. Angular Acceleration Z
15. Angular Acceleration Magnitude
16. Angular Velocity X
17. Angular Velocity Y
18. Angular Velocity Z
19. Angular Velocity Magnitude
20. Angular Displacement X
21. Angular Displacement Y
22. Angular Displacement Z
23. Angular Displacement Magnitude
24. Magnetometer X
25. Magnetometer Y
26. Magnetometer Z
27. Magnetometer Magnitude
